    <p>The series revolves around four older, single women (three widows and one divorcée) sharing a house in Miami, Florida. <br />The owner of the house is a widow named Blanche Devereaux (RueMcClanahan), who was joined by fellow widow Rose<br /> Nylund (Wendy Bite) and divorcée Dorothy Zbornak (Bea Arthur). They both responded to a room-for-rent ad on the<br /> bulletin board of a local grocery store. In the pilot episode, the women had a gay cook named Coco (Charles Levin), who was subsequently removed.[5] The three were soon joined by Dorothy's mother, Sophia Petrillo (Estelle Getty), after the retirement home where she lived, Shady Pines, burned down.</p>
